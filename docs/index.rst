This is a documentation test for the Dohom_Trial.jl Module. The module is still under construction and is still not usable.
	     
Description
-----------

The module generates random domestic hot water hydrographs from several end-use devices such as

*showers
*taps
*Washing Machines
*Dishwashers
*etc.

It works in combination with the model WENexH.jl, and is used for the heat and water flows modeling of such end-use appliances. Stay tuned, more to come...
